title: "Camel: remote code execution via header field manipulation"
description: > 
    A flaw was found in Apache Camel""s parsing of the FILE_NAME header. A remote 
    attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would write the 
    provided message to a file, could provide expression language (EL) 
    expressions in the FILE_NAME header, which would be evaluated on the server. 
    This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the 
    Camel server process.
