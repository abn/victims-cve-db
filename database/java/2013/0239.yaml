title: "jbossws-cxf, apache-cxf: UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and UsernameTokenInterceptor allow empty passwords to authenticate"
description: > 
    It was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and 
    UsernameTokenInterceptor allow a UsernameToken element with no password child 
    element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this flaw to 
    circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the password 
    in a UsernameToken. If an incorrect password is provided, authentication will 
    fail, but if the password is omitted, it will succeed. This flaw is 
    exploitable on web services that rely on WS-SecurityPolicy plaintext 
    UsernameTokens to authenticate users. It is not exploitable when using hashed 
    passwords or WS-Security without WS-SecurityPolicy.
