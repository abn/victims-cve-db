title: "JBoss RichFaces: Remote code execution due to insecure deserialization"
description: >
    A flaw was found in the way JBoss RichFaces handled deserialization. A 
    remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the 
    deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. 
    This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the 
    deserialization logic of these classes.
