title: "Apache Santuario XML Security for Java: XML signature spoofing"
description: >
    A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java validated 
    XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an arbitrary 
    canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the SignedInfo XML 
    fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an XML signature, via 
    a specially-crafted XML signature block.
