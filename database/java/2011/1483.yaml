title: JBossWS remote Denial of Service
description: > 
    wsf/common/DOMUtils.java in JBossWS Native does not properly handle recursion
    during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of 
    service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted request containing an XML 
    document with a DOCTYPE declaration and a large number of nested entity 
    references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
affected:
    - groupId: "org.jboss.ws"
      artifactId: "jbossws-common"
      version:
        - "==1.1.0.SP7"
