title: "JNDI: unauthenticated remote write access is permitted by default"
description: > 
    It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allows unauthenticated remote write 
    access by default. The JNDI service, HA-JNDI service and HAJNDIFactory invoker 
    servlet are all affected. A remote attacker that is able to access port 1099 
    (JNDI), port 1100 (HA-JNDI) or the HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss 
    server could exploit this flaw to add, delete and modify items in the JNDI 
    tree. This could lead to a wide range of attacks, affecting the integrity, 
    availability and confidentiality of the system.
