title: "JBoss Cache: NonManagedConnectionFactory will log password in clear text when an exception occurs"
description: >
    It was found that the NonManagedConnectionFactory would log the username and 
    password in cleartext when an exception was thrown. A local attacker could 
    exploitthis flaw by reading the password from the log file, if they had 
    appropriate permissions to read the log file.
