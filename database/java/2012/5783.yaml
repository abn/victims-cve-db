description: >

    (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server 
    hostname matches a domain name in the subject""s Common Name (CN) or 
    subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle 
    attackers to spoof SSL servers via andaarbitrary valid certificate.
